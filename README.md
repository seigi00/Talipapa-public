# Talipapa

Talipapa is a Flutter-based mobile application that forecasts commodity prices in the Philippines for 2 weeks using the SARIMA algorithm.
Utilizing web-scraping techniques to scrape the past week's commodity price data from the Department of Agriculture's (DA) PriceWatch website, 
and a sophisticated combination of time-series algorithms, Talipapa delivers a timely and accurate prediction for wet market vendors and consumers. 
It also features interactive graphs, and a chatbot that can communicate in English and Tagalog to facilitate user understanding.
